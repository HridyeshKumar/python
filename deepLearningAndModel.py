#Introduction to Deep Learning and Model on Iris Dataset
#Deep Learning Framework
'''Deep Learning is a field within Machine Learning that deals with building amd using Neural Network Models.
Neural Networks mimic the functioning of a human brain.
Neural Networks with more than three layers are typically categorised as Deep Learning Networks.'''
#Perceptron
'''The Perceptron is the unit of learning in an artificial neural networks.A Perceptron resembles a human brain cell.
A Perceptron is a single cell or node in a neural network.
